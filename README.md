# NeuralMachineTranslation

This repo contains code of two neural machine translation projects. Both projects make use of ASLG-PC12 dataset (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227339312_English-ASL_Gloss_Parallel_Corpus_2012_ASLG-PC12), which can be downloaded from here https://achrafothman.net/site/asl-smt/ .

The /RNN_Seq2Seq_NMT project implements Neural Machine Translation from ASL to English using RNN Attention based Encoder-Decoder architectures. 

The /Transformer_NMT project implements Neural Machine Translation from ASL to English using Transformer (https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) architecture.
